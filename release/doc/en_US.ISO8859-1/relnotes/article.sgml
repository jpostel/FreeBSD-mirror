  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current;.	It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.current [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents the latest point along the &release.branch; development
    branch since &release.branch; was created.	Information regarding pre-built, binary
    &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

]]>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.
    Information regarding
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

<![ %release.type.release [

  <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
    &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
    url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.	 More
    information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
    distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink

    <title>What's New</title>

    <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
      features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

    <para>Typical release note items document recent security
      advisories issued after &release.prev;, new drivers or hardware
      support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or
      contributed software upgrades.  They may also list changes to
      major ports/packages or release engineering practices.  Clearly
      the release notes cannot list every single change made to &os;
      between releases; this document focuses primarily on security
      advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
      improvements.</para>

      <title>Kernel Changes</title>

      <para>The &man.ddb.4; debugger has been improved:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>It now supports <command>show
	      ifnets</command> and <command>show ifnet <replaceable>struct
		ifnet *</replaceable></command> commands to print a list of

	    respectively.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>It now supports <command>show all
	      lltables</command>, <command>show lltable
	      <replaceable>struct lltable *</replaceable></command>, and
	    <command>show llentry <replaceable>struct llentry
		*</replaceable></command> commands to print a list of
	    <quote>lltable *</quote> of each virtual network stack,
	    fields of specified structures respectively.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The <command>show mount</command> command now prints
	    active string mount options.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>It now supports <command>show
	      vnetrcrs</command> command to dump the whole log of
	    distinctive <varname>curvnet</varname> recursion
	    events.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>It now supports <command>show
	      vnet_sysinit</command> and <command>show
	      vnet_unsysinit</command> commands to print
	    ordered call lists.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The default &man.devfs.5; rules now expose the upper 256
	of &man.pty.4; device nodes.</para>

      <para>A new kernel thread called <quote>deadlock
	  resolver</quote> has been added.  This can be used to detect
	possible deadlock by using information of thread state and
	heuristic analysis.  This is not enabled by default.  To
	enable this, an option <option>option DEADLKRES</option> in
	kernel configuration file and recompilation of the
	kernel.</para>

      <para>Two commands to enable/disable read-ahead have been added
	to &man.fcntl.2; system call:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><varname>F_READAHEAD</varname> specifies the amount
	    for sequential access.  The amount is specified in bytes and is

	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Note that the read-ahead amount is also limited by
	sysctl variable <varname>vfs.read_max</varname>, which may
	need to be raised in order to better utilize this
	feature.</para>

      <para>The &man.lindev.4; driver has been added.  This is for
	supporting various Linux-specific pseudo devices such as
	<filename>/dev/full</filename>.  Note that this is not
	included in <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.</para>

      <para>A POSIX function pselect(3) has been reimplemented as a
	system call &man.pselect.2; to eliminate race
	condition.</para>

      <para>A kernel option <option>option
	  INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILE</option> has been added to
	<filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel by default.</para>

      <para>New SDT (Statically Defined Tracing) probes such as ones
	for <literal>opencrypto</literal> and <literal>vnet</literal>
	have been added to &os; &man.dtrace.1; subsystem.</para>

      <para arch="powerpc">&os; now supports SMP in PowerPC G5
	systems.  Note that SMP support on &os;/&arch.powerpc; is
	disabled by default in <filename>GENERIC</filename>
	kernel.</para>

      <para arch="sparc64">&os; now supports UltraSPARC IV, IV+, and
	SPARC64 V CPUs.</para>

      <para>A bug in the &man.tty.4; driver that
	<varname>TIOCSTI</varname> did not work has been fixed.  This
	affects applications like &man.mail.1;.</para>

      <para>A bug in the &man.sched.4bsd.4; scheduler that the
	timestamp for the sleeping operation is not cleaned up on the
	wakeup has been fixed.</para>

      <para>A race condition in the &man.sched.4bsd.4; scheduler has
	been fixed.</para>

      <para>A bug in the &man.sched.ule.4; scheduler which prevented
	process usage (<literal>%CPU</literal>) from working correctly
	has been fixed.</para>

      <para>The &man.syscons.4; driver has been improved.  The history
	buffer can be fully saved/restored in the VESA mode switching
	via a loader tunable
	<varname>hint.sc.<replaceable>0</replaceable>.vesa_mode</varname>.</para>

      <para arch="amd64,i386">An x86 real mode emulator based on
	OpenBSD's x86emu implementation has been added to improve real
	mode BIOS call support on both &arch.i386; and &arch.amd64;.
	The &man.atkbdc.4;, &man.dpms.4;, vesa(4), &man.vga.4; driver
	now use this emulator and work on the both platforms.</para>

      <para>The VIMAGE &man.jail.8; virtualization container can work
	with &man.sctp.4; now.  Note that the VIMAGE is not enabled by
	default in <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.</para>

      <para>The VIMAGE &man.jail.8; now supports
	<varname>ip4.saddrsel</varname>,
	<varname>ip4.nosaddrsel</varname>,
	<varname>ip6.saddrsel</varname>, and
	<varname>ip6.nosaddrsel</varname> to control whether to use
	source address selection or the primary jail address for
	unbound outgoing connections.  The default value is to use
	source address selection.</para>

      <sect3 id="boot">
	<title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

	<para arch="pc98">The <filename>boot2</filename> bootcode has
	  been reimplemented based on the &arch.i386 counterpart.  It
	  now supports ELF binary, UFS2 file system, and larger number
	  of slices.</para>

	<para arch="ia64">The EFI <filename>loader</filename> program
	  now supports a command-line option <option>-dev
	    <replaceable>currdev</replaceable></option> to specify the
	  default value of <varname>currdev</varname>.  This option
	  can be set by the EFI boot manager.</para>

	<para arch="powerpc">The &man.loader.8; program now supports
	  U-Boot storage.</para>

        <para>A kernel environment variable
	  <varname>vfs.root.mountfrom</varname> now supports
	  multiple elements for root file system in a space-separated
	  list.  Each list element will be tried in order and the
	  first available one will be mounted.</para>

	<para arch="i386">The algorithm the &man.loader.8; uses has
	  been improved to choose a memory range for its heap when
	  using a range above 1MB.  This fixes a symptom that the
	  loader fails to load a kernel.</para>

        <para>The <filename>zfsloader</filename> has been added.  This
	  is a separate &man.zfs.8; enabled loader.  Note that a ZFS
	  bootcode (<filename>zfsboot</filename> or
	  <filename>gptzfsboot</filename>) need to be installed
	  to use this new loader.</para>

        <para>The <filename>zfsboot</filename> and
	  <filename>gptzfsboot</filename> bootcode now fully support
	  64-bit LBAs for disk addresses.  This allows booting from
	  large volumes.</para>

	a variable <varname>NO_PROXY</varname> has been fixed.</para>

      <para>A bug in &man.find.1; utility has been fixed.  An option
	<option>-newerXB</option> was interpreted as the same as
	<option>-newerXm</option>.</para>

      <para>A bug in the &man.fnmatch.3; function has been fixed.  The

	interface.</para>

      <para>The &man.indent.1; utility now supports a
	<option>-ta</option> flag to treat all
	<literal>_t</literal>-suffixed identifiers as types.</para>

      <para>The <filename>liblzma</filename> library for LZMA2
	lossless data compression algorithm and the userland utilities
	&man.xz.1;, &man.xzdec.1;, &man.lzma.1;, and &man.lzmainfo.1;.
	has been imported.  When the old system is upgraded to
	&release.current;, deinstalling a version found in the Ports
	Collection (<filename>archivers/xz</filename>) and
	recompilation of the packages which depend on it may be
	required.</para>

      <para arch="amd64,i386">The <filename>libz</filename> library
	has been improved in performance.  For &os/&arch.i386;, note
	that this improvement uses instructions only on i686-class CPU
	and they are disabled by default.  Specifying
	<literal>CPUTYPE=pentium4</literal> in
	<filename>/etc/make.conf</filename> enables them.</para>

      <para>The &man.ln.1; utility now reports an error correctly when
	a <option>-f</option> flag and two same file entries were
	specified in the command line option.  It removed the file
	first and then reported a <quote>not found</quote>
	error.</para>

      <para>The &man.ln.1; utility now removes trailing slash
	characters when creating a link to a directory.  The following
	command sequence reported an error in the previous

      <para>The &man.netstat.1; utility now supports ARP information
	in statistics shown by the <option>-s</option> flag.</para>

      <para>The &man.netstat.1; utility now supports a <option>-q
	  <replaceable>number</replaceable></option> option to specify
	the number of outputs.  This is used in conjunction with
	<option>-w</option> option.</para>

      <para>The &man.newfs.msdos.8; utility now uses
	<literal>NO_NAME</literal> as the default volume label and
	<literal>BSD4.4</literal> as the OEM String.</para>

      <para>The &man.newsyslog.8; utility does not consider
	non-existence of a PID file as an error now.  A new flag
	<option>-P</option> reverts it to the old behavior.</para>

      <para>The &man.ntpd.8; program no longer tries to bind to an
	IPv6 anycast address.</para>

      <para>The &man.pam.krb5.8; PAM module now supports
	<option>no_user_check</option> option.  This allows to
	authorize a user not known to the local system.</para>

      <para>The &man.pathchk.1; utility now supports a
	<option>-P</option> flag defined in POSIX-1.2008.  This checks
	for empty pathnames and components starting with
	<quote><literal>-</literal></quote>.</para>

      <para>A variable <varname>daily_clean_tmps_ignore</varname>
	which is used in the &man.periodic.8; daily script now has
	<filename>/tmp/.snap</filename>.  This prevents
	<filename>/tmp/.snap</filename> from being removed.</para>

      <para>The &man.procstat.1; utility now supports two new flags
	<option>-i</option> and <option>-j</option> to display
	information about signal disposition and pending/blocked
	status for signals.</para>

      <para>The &man.pwait.1; utility has been added.  This is similar
	to the Solaris utility of the same name, and waits for any
	process to terminate.</para>

      <para>A bug in the &man.restore.8; utility which caused short
	reads when a option <option>-P</option> was used has been
	fixed.</para>

      <para>The &man.rtsold.8; <option>-a</option> flag now excludes
	the interfaces which IPv6 or accepting ICMPv6 Router
	Advertisement message is disabled from the auto-probed
	interface list.</para>

      <para>The &man.scandir.3; and &man.alphasort.3; functions has
	been updated to conform POSIX.1-2008 (IEEE Std
	1003.1-2008).</para>

      <para>The &man.sed.1; utility now supports a <option>-r</option>
	flag which means exactly the same as a <option>-E</option>
	flag.  This is for compatibility with the GNU version.</para>

      <para>The service name database &man.services.5; (usually in
	<filename>/etc/services</filename>) now also supports a
	&man.db.3; style database for better lookup performance.  The
	following entry in <filename>/etc/nsswitch.conf</filename>
	enables use of the binary database file:</para>

      <programlisting>services: db</programlisting>

      <para>Note that the &man.db.3; style database can be created by
	&man.services.mkdb.8; at
	<filename>/var/db/service.db</filename>.</para>

      <para>The &man.sighold.2;, &man.sigignore.2;, &man.sigpause.2;,
	&man.sigrelse.2;, and &man.sigset.2; functions have been
	implemented for making porting software from System V-like
	systems easy.  Note that these are defined in POSIX.1-2008 XSI
	(IEEE Std 1003.1-2008, X/Open System Interface) but now
	obsolete.  Since &os; already has another
	<function>sigpause(3)</function> function derived from 4.2BSD,
	a version of the XSI interface is implemented as
	<function>xsi_sigpause()</function>.</para>

      <para>The &man.sshd.8;, &man.cron.8;, &man.inetd.8;, and
	&man.syslogd.8; programs now set
	<literal>MADV_PROTECT</literal> memory flag onto themselves to
	protect from being terminated by the &os; kernel when
	available memory becomes short.  This kind of process
	termination happens in a swap-intensive workload.</para>

      <para>The &man.stat.1; utility now supports
	<literal>%Sf</literal> output specifier to display the file
	flags symbolically.</para>

      <para>The &man.strsignal.3; function is now thread-safe.</para>

      <para>The &man.sysctl.8; utility now supports a
	<option>-i</option> flag to ignore failures while retrieving
	individual OIDs.  This allows the same list of OIDs to be
	passed to &man.sysctl.8; across different systems where
	particular OIDs may not exist, and still get as much
	information as possible from them.</para>

      <para>The &man.traceroute.8; utility now performs source address
	selection correctly even in a VIMAGE &man.jail.8;
	environment.</para>

      <para>The &man.unifdef.1; utility has been updated to version
	1.188.  It now supports a new <option>-B</option> flag to
	compress blank lines around a deleted section to prevent blank
	lines around paragraphs of code from getting doubled.</para>

      <para>The &man.unzip.1; utility now supports the rename query
	when a file with the same name as the one about to be
	extracted already exists.</para>

      <para>The &man.unzip.1; utility now supports
	<option>-C</option>, <option>-c</option>, <option>-f</option>,
	<option>-p</option>, and <option>-v</option> flags which are
	compatible with Info-ZIP.</para>

      <para>The &man.usbconfig.8; utility now supports a new flag
	<option>-d</option> to specify the &man.ugen.4; device, and
	<command>add_quirk</command> and
	<command>remove_quirk</command> commands.</para>

      <para>The &man.whois.1; utility now supports searching IPv6
	addresses just like IPv4 without specifying the ARIN server.
	A <option>-d</option> flag has been removed because it is now
	obsolete.</para>

      <para>A new errno <varname>ENOTCAPABLE</varname> has been added.
	This is to be returned when a process requests an operation on
	a file descriptor that is not authorized by the descriptor's
	capability flags.</para>

      <para>The &man.zfs.8; command now supports a new flag
	<option>receive -u</option> to specify that the received ZFS
	should not be mounted automatically.</para>

      <sect3 id="rc-scripts">
        <title><filename>/etc/rc.d</filename> Scripts</title>

        <para>The &man.service.8; command has been added.  This
	  provides an easy command-line interface to the
	  <filename>rc.d</filename> system.</para>

        <para>The <filename>rc.d/ipfw</filename> script and
	  <filename>/etc/rc.firewall</filename> now supports IPv6 and
	  <filename>rc.d/ip6fw</filename> script and
	  <filename>/etc/rc.firewall6</filename> are obsolete.  Note
	  that <varname>ipv6_firewall_*</varname> variables in
	  &man.rc.conf.5; are replaced with
	  <varname>firewall_client_net_ipv6</varname>,
	  <varname>firewall_simple_iif_ipv6</varname>,
	  <varname>firewall_simple_inet_ipv6</varname>,
	  <varname>firewall_simple_oif_ipv6</varname>,
	  <varname>firewall_simple_onet_ipv6</varname>.</para>

        <para>A new <filename>rc.d</filename> script
	  <filename>rc.d/rtsold</filename> has been added.  This handles
	  &man.rtsold.8; daemon.</para>

        <para>A new <filename>rc.d</filename> script
	  <filename>rc.d/static_arp</filename> has been added.  This allows
	  the administrator to statically define mappings of MAC
	  address to IPv4 at boot time.  See also the &man.rc.conf.5;
	  manual page for more details.</para>

        <para>The <filename>rc.d/tmp</filename> script now uses a
	  unique directory name prefixed with
	  <filename>/tmp/.diskless</filename> instead of
	  <filename>/tmp/.diskless</filename> itself.  This fixes an
	  issue when <filename>/tmp/.diskless</filename> exists before
	  the script runs.</para>

        <para>A new <filename>rc.d</filename> script
	  <filename>rc.d/ubthidhci</filename> has been added.  This
	  small script calls &man.usbconfig.8; to change a USB
	  Bluetooth controller from HID mode to HCI mode.</para>

        <para>The &man.rc.conf.5; now supports a
	  <varname>firewall_coscripts</varname> variable.  This should
	  contain a list of commands which should be executed after
	  firewall starts or stops.</para>

        <para>The &man.rc.conf.5; now supports configuring
	  &man.vlan.4; interfaces as child devices similar to
	  &man.wlan.4; interfaces.  &man.vlan.4; interfaces are listed
	  via a new
	  <varname>vlans_<replaceable>IF</replaceable></varname>
	  variable.  If a VLAN interface is a number, then that number
	  is treated as the VLAN tag for the interface and the
	  interface will be named
	  <varname><replaceable>IF</replaceable>.<replaceable>tag</replaceable></varname>.
	  Otherwise, the VLAN tag must be provided via a VLAN
	  parameter in a
	  <varname>create_args_<replaceable>IF</replaceable></varname>
	  variable.</para>
