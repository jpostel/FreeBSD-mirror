  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current;.	It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.current [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents the latest point along the &release.branch; development
    branch since &release.branch; was created.	Information regarding pre-built, binary
    &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

]]>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.
    Information regarding
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

<![ %release.type.release [

  <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
    &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
    url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.	 More
    information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
    distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink

    &os;</quote> appendix</ulink> to the <ulink
    url="&url.books.handbook;/">&os;
    Handbook</ulink>.</para>

]]>

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.	 Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

    <title>What's New</title>

    <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
      features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

    <para>Typical release note items document recent security
      advisories issued after &release.prev;, new drivers or hardware
      support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or
      contributed software upgrades.  They may also list changes to
      major ports/packages or release engineering practices.  Clearly
      the release notes cannot list every single change made to &os;
      between releases; this document focuses primarily on security
      advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
      improvements.</para>

    <sect2 id="security">

      <title>Kernel Changes</title>

      <para></para>

      <para>The <command>show mount</command> command in the
	&man.ddb.4; debugger now prints active string mount
	options.</para>

      <para>The default &man.devfs.5; rules now expose the upper 256
	of &man.pty.4; device nodes.</para>

      <para>A new kernel thread called <quote>deadlock
	  resolver</quote> has been added.  This can be used to detect
	possible deadlock by using information of thread state and
	heuristical analysis.  This is not enabled by default.  To
	enable this, an option <option>option DEADLKRES</option> in
	kernel configuration file and recompilation of the
	kernel.</para>

      <para>Two commands to enable/disable read-ahead has been added
	to &man.fcntl.2; system call:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><varname>F_READAHEAD</varname> specifies the amount
	    for sequential access.  The amount is specified in bytes and is
	    rounded up to nearest block size.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><varname>F_RDAHEAD</varname> is a Darwin compatible
	    version that use 128KB as the sequential access
	    size.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Note that the read-ahead amount is also constrainted by
	sysctl variable <varname>vfs.read_max</varname>, which may
	need to be raised in order to better utilize this
	feature.</para>

      <para>The &man.lindev.4; driver has been added.  This is for
	supporting various linux-specific pseudo devices such as
	<filename>/dev/full</filename>.  Note that this is not
	included in <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.</para>

      <para>A POSIX function pselect(3) has been reimplemented as a
	system call &man.pselect.2; to eliminate race
	condition.</para>

      <para>A kernel option <option>option
	  INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILE</option> has been added to
	<filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel by default.</para>

      <para>New SDT (Statically Defined Tracing) probes such as ones
	for opencrypto have been added to &os; &man.dtrace.1;
	subsystem.</para>

      <para arch="powerpc">&os; now supports SMP in PowerPC G5
	systems.  Note that SMP support is disabled by default in
	<filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.</para>

      <para>A bug in the &man.tty.4; driver that
	<varname>TIOCSTI</varname> did not work has been fixed.  This
	affects applications like &man.mail.1;.</para>

      <para>A bug in the &man.sched.4bsd.4; scheduler that the
	timestamp for the sleeping operation is not cleaned up on the
	wakeup has been fixed.</para>

      <para>A bug in the &man.sched.ule.4; scheduler which prevented
	process usage (<literal>%CPU</literal>) from working correctly
	has been fixed.</para>

      <para>The VIMAGE &man.jail.8; virtualization container can work
	with &man.sctp.4; now.  Note that the VIMAGE is not enabled by
	default in <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.</para>

      <para>The VIMAGE &man.jail.8; now supports
	<varname>ip4.saddrsel</varname>,
	<varname>ip4.nosaddrsel</varname>,
	<varname>ip6.saddrsel</varname>, and
	<varname>ip6.nosaddrsel</varname> to control whether to use
	source address selection or the primary jail address for
	unbound outgoing connections.  The default value is to use
	source address selection.</para>

      <sect3 id="boot">
	<title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

	<para arch="pc98">The <filename>boot2</filename> bootcode has
	  been reimplemented based on the &arch.i386 counterpart.  It
	  now supports ELF binary, UFS2 file system, and larger number
	  of slices.</para>

	<para arch="ia64">The EFI <filename>loader</filename> program
	  now supports a command-line option <option>-dev
	    <replaceable>currdev</replaceable></option> to specify the
	  default value of <varname>currdev</varname>.  This option
	  can be set by the EFI boot manager.</para>

        <para>A kernel environment variable
	  <varname>vfs.root.mountfrom</varname> now supports
	  multiple elements for root file system in a space-separated
	  list.  Each list element will be tried in order and the
	  first available one will be mounted.</para>

	<para arch="i386">The algorithm the &man.loader.8; uses has
	  been improved to choose a memory range for its heap when
	  using a range above 1MB.  This fixes a symptom that the
	  loader fails to load a kernel.</para>

        <para>The <filename>zfsloader</filename> has been added.  This
	  is a separate &man.zfs.8; enabled loader.  Note that a ZFS
	  bootcode (<filename>zfsboot</filename> or
	  <filename>gptzfsboot</filename>) need to be installed
	  to use this new loader.</para>

        <para>The <filename>zfsboot</filename> and
	  <filename>gptzfsboot</filename> bootcode now fully support
	  64-bit LBAs for disk addresses.  This allows booting from
	  large volumes.</para>

	    (4.0 and 7.1) playback support.  The 5.1 mode support is
	    disabled now due to unidentified synchonization problem.
	    Devices which supports the 7.1 mode can handle the 5.1
	    operation via software upmix done by &man.sound.4;.  Note
	    that stereo stream is no longer duplicated to all

	  option <option>negnametimeo</option> can be used to override
	  the default timeout interval (60 seconds) on a

	   of the directory vnodes that are source of the namecache
	   records.  This is not enabled by default because for
